Music Event Manager (Work in progress)
--------------------------------------
This system was designed and implemented as a part of Bachelor thesis. It offers artists, technicians, venue owners
and gear rental companies to make their offers and put them on the community marketplace. Organizers by browsing the
marketplace can choose their own lineups and manage newly created events, interacting with their contractors. All users
involved in particular event are being reviewed when the event is marked as finished by the organizer.
