    <h3>About the project:</h3>
    <p>This system was designed and implemented as a part of Bachelor thesis. It offers artists, technicians, venue owners
        and gear rental companies to make their offers and put them on the community marketplace. Organizers by browsing the
        marketplace can choose their own lineups and manage newly created events, interacting with their contractors. All users
        involved in particular event are being reviewed when the event is marked as finished by the organizer.
